# 🌳 EcoGuard – AI-Powered Drone Surveillance for Forest Protection

**EcoGuard** is an innovative AI-based drone surveillance system designed to protect forests from illegal activities like **poaching**, **logging**, and **wildfires**. It combines **real-time AI object detection**, **blockchain-secured data**, and **long-range communication (LoRa FANET)** to provide an autonomous, tamper-proof, and scalable solution for environmental monitoring.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

EcoGuard enables forest departments, NGOs, and conservation agencies to:
- Monitor forests in real-time with drones
- Automatically detect threats (humans, fires, deforestation)
- Secure the data using blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric)
- Operate even in no-internet zones using LoRa-based FANET
- Allow public reporting of incidents through a website portal

## 🧠 Core Technologies Used

- 🔍 **YOLOv5** – Real-time object detection (human, fire, axe, etc.)
- 🔗 **Hyperledger Fabric (PBFT)** – Securing surveillance logs on blockchain
- 📡 **LoRa & FANET** – Enables drone communication without internet
- 🌍 **Google Earth Engine** – Visualizing real-time geospatial forest data
- 🌐 **Web Portal** – For public incident reporting & map-based dashboard  


---

## 🔄 How It Works

1. Drones fly autonomously over forest zones.
2. YOLOv5 processes live video feed to detect threats.
3. Data is securely transmitted using LoRa to a central node.
4. Detected incidents are stored immutably using blockchain.
5. Reports are visualized and alerts are sent to officials.
6. Public can also report illegal activity through the web portal.
